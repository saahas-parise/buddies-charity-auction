For the product guru, we increased the amount of data points we currently had in our database and implemented pagination to accommodate only a limited number of products per page. Also, we added the expiration of each product to the product table. In addition, we added different ways you can sort projects including most expensive, least expensive, recently added, and closing soon. Furthermore, now when you click on a product image or name, it takes you to the product page which gives you more info about that specific product. Here, we also implemented the bidding process and added the bids table. We created a function to update a product’s price based on its current max bid. Users can insert an amount they want to bid and it checks if the user is authenticated, if the bid is higher than the current amount, and if the user has enough money in their account to make the bid. Then it changes the current price on the site and adds that bid into the bid table which included the user id, product Id and bid amount. The reason it just doesn’t change the user id and amount is because in the future we hope to implement a bid progress tracker where each user can see if their bid is the highest or they need to update it before the deadline.

For the user guru, we filled our database with the list of generated users, emails, passwords, etc. We added a balance attribute that indicates the amount of money in a user’s account. There’s a button on the main screen for a user to view their account info. When clicked, a user can view their username, email, current balance, and recent purchases. A user can also withdraw and deposit money into the account under the account info section, and their amount is increased/decreased respectively. When a user logs in, they can indicate whether they’re a buyer or charity, and their information is entered into the respective table. Users can look at their recent purchases to see the product name, their purchase amount, and the time of purchase. The purchases table joins with the product table to get the product name and time of purchase. When a user bids on an item, the product bid price is updated and the user’s balance is decremented. A user can only bid as much money deposited into their account and their bid must be higher than the current bid price of the product. In the future, we would like to implement a different home screen for charity and customer users.
For the cart guru, we implemented a wishlist because our platform uses a bidding feature and does not require implementing a cart. However, the wishlist has very similar functionality, which we worked on implementing into our database design, changing the cart design from Milestone 3. We added a wishlist button for every product where users can add items they're interested in and see the items by using the wishlist button on the homepage. If a user is not logged in, they cannot add anything to the wishlist and are redirected to the login page. Once logged in, they can add a product to the wishlist and view the updated total price. They can also see the name of the product, the name of the charity, and the price of each individual product. Lastly, if a user no longer wants a product, they can remove it using the remove button. For the implementation itself, we edited my cart table which contains a buyer id and product id that borrow from the Users and Products tables. We plan to add more metadata about the productto the wishlist page and table as well as a way to access product description from the wishlist.

For the socials guru, we implemented some key changes to enhance the user experience and functionality. Firstly, users can now submit a single rating or review for a product through a dedicated submission link on the detailed product page, preventing multiple submissions for the same product.  Users also now have the ability to edit or remove their existing ratings or reviews. We also implemented an interface allows individuals to list all their authored ratings and reviews, sorted in reverse chronological order by default. This interface also enables users to selectively update their ratings and reviews. The link to this interface has also been integrated into the user account view. Lastly, we introduced summary ratings for each individual product, featuring average ratings, the total number of ratings, and the ratings sorted by score. To improve navigation, a "go back" button was added on the "My Reviews" page, enhancing the user's experience when searching for reviews of other users. We plan to add upvote functionality to reviews so that it would be easier to see more relevant/helpful reviews and implement reviews for the individual charities.

For the chairty/sellers guru, we streamlined the user registration process, allowing users to register as sellers or charities in one go. For charities, we added a practical "See Inventory" button for a quick overview of ongoing auctions. We made it easy for charities to add new items to their inventory with user-friendly text boxes for essential attributes like price, expiration date, and product name. Additionally, we ensured a straightforward process for removing items from the inventory. When logged in as a charity, a dedicated page displaying order history was introduced, allowing for easy tracking and modification of order fulfillment status. Looking ahead, we plan to incorporate analytics into both the inventory and order fulfillment pages to provide insights into product popularity and trends. These updates aim to enhance user experience and contribute to the success of the Buddies Charities Auction initiative.
